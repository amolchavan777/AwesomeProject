## Release Logging

A release log is maintained in `RELEASE_LOG.md`. After each commit you can run the following commands to update the release log and append the latest commit information to this README:

```bash
npm run generate-release-log
npm run update-readme
```

These scripts capture commit metadata such as hash, author, date, and message. Each entry is appended to the release log and to the README so that commit history is tracked directly in the repository documentation.
